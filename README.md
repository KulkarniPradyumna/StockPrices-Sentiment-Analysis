# StockPrices-Sentiment-Analysis

<strong>Overview</strong>
This repository contains code for sentiment analysis of stock prices using NLTK library and the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm. The classifier is designed to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of stock-related news or social media posts to help investors make informed decisions.

<strong>Dataset</strong>
The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of stock-related news or social media posts, along with their corresponding sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set for model evaluation.

<strong>Requirements</strong>
Python 3.x
NLTK library

<strong>To install the required libraries, use the following command:</strong>
pip install nltk

<strong>How to Use</strong>
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
Run the StockPrice.ipynb script.
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the text data, and train the Naive Bayes classifier.
After training, the script will prompt you to enter a stock-related news or social media post.
The classifier will predict the sentiment of the input text as positive, negative, or neutral.

<strong>Customization</strong>
You can modify the StockPrice.ipynb script to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, or even try out other machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis.

<strong>Acknowledgments</strong>
The development of this stock prices sentiment analysis is inspired by the NLTK library's capabilities and the extensive research on sentiment analysis in the finance domain.
